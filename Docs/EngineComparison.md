**Engine Comparative Study**



* In all three engines, I noticed that transforming objects worked nearly identically. The shortcut keys were all the same, each object behaved how I expected it to, and everything could also be changed in a preview window on the right. However, importing in each editor was quite different. In Unreal, the textures of objects didn't work at all, and many assets were missing parts, such as the flag at the top of the ship (which I attached manually using a different asset). In Unity, every part of the assets were there, but the textures were not. In Godot, everything imported perfectly fine, including the textures. 
* Unreal's actor blueprints make instancing reliant on editing the object's code, transforms, etc. in a separate window, using graphs and a viewport. Prefabs in Unity worked intuitively by just dragging the objects into the content folder to be used for instancing later, and Godot uses a more coding-heavy approach to instance objects with packed scenes, which is somewhat similar to Unreal's blueprint "coding," but much less intuitive it and Unity.
* Although Godot had the best asset importing, and Unity had the easiest instancing, I would much prefer to rebuild the level again in Unreal's blueprinting system, as I am already familiar with it and love the visual scripting nodes and camera controls.
